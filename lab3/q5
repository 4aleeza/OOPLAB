/*Create a class called Book to represent a book. A Book should include four pieces of information as instance
variables‚Äêa book name, an ISBN number, an author name and a publisher. Provide methods (query method) for
each instance variable. Inaddition, provide a method named getBookInfo that returns the description of the book
as a String (the description should include all the information about the book). You should use this keyword in
member methods and constructor. Write a test application named BookTest to create an array of object for 5
elements for class Book to demonstrate the class Book's capabilities.*/
