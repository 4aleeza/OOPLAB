/*Create A class called Invoice that a hardware store might use to represent an invoice for an item sold at the
store. An Invoice should include four pieces of information as instance variables - a part number (type String), a
part description (type String), a quantity of the item being purchased (type int) and a price per item (double).

Your class should have a constructor that initialize the four instance variables. In addition, provide a method
named getInvoiceAmount that calculates the invoice amount (i.e., multiples the quantity by the price per item),
then returns the amount as a double value. If the quantity is not positive, it should be set to 0. If the price per
item is not positive, it should be set to 0.0.*/

using namespace std;
class Invoice {
	string pn; //part number
	string desc; 
	int quan; //quantity
	double ppi; //price per item
	double ia; // invoice amount
public:
	Invoice(string, string, int, double);
	double getinvoiceamount() {
		if (quan < 0) {
			quan = 0;
		}
		if (ppi < 0) {
			ppi = 0.0;
		}
		ia = quan * ppi;
		return ia;
	}
};
Invoice::Invoice(string a, string b, int c, double d) {
	pn = a;

	Invoice obj(a, b, c, d);
	double retval = obj.getinvoiceamount();
