/*A book shop maintains the inventory of books that are being sold at the shop. The list includes details such as
author, title, price, publisher and stock position. Whenever a customer wants a book, the sales person inputs the
title and author and the system searches the list and displays whether it is available or not. If it is not, an
appropriate message is displayed. If it is, then the system displays the book details and requests for the number
of copies required. If the requested copies are available, the total cost of the requested copies is displayed;
otherwise "Required copies not in stock" is displayed. Design a system using a class called books with suitable
member functions and constructors.*/
