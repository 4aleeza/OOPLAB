/*Consider there are two structures Employee (depended structure) and another structure called
Organisation(Outer structure). The structure Organization has the data members like
organisation_name,organisation_number. The Employee structure is nested inside the structure
Organization and it has the data members like
employee_id, name, salary.
org.emp.employee_id;
org.emp.name;
org.emp.salary;
org.organisation_name;
org.organisation_number;
Here, org is the structure variable of the outer structure Organisation and emp is the structure variable of
the inner structure Employee.*/
